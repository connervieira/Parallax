# Parallax

**Copyright 2024 V0LT - Conner Vieira**

A rapid navigation system that takes a new, performance-centric approach to transportation.


## Note

Parallax is extremely early in development. Many of the features described here have not yet been implemented.


## Description

Parallax is designed to be the navigation system for people who want to put driving before the destination. Unlike other navigation systems, it takes a back-seat, subdued approach to directions, and provides basic information about locations around you. Parallax allows you to drop 'beacons' at important locations, and leave notes for future reference. It can autonomously locate data about surrounding points-of-interest, like business phone numbers, road speed limits, and parking spaces. Think of Parallax as a copilot in the passenger seat to help with tedious navigation tasks, not a map to give you step-by-step directions to your destination.


## Features

These are some of the key features of Parallax.

### Lightweight

Parallax doesn't have a graphical interface, and is designed to be as lightweight and efficient as possible.

### Comprehensive

Parallax uses OpenStreetMap data with an in-depth, community developed map.

### Repairable

Parallax follows a philosophy of repairability by providing the user with everything they need to diagnose and resolve problems independently.

### Open Source

Parallax is free and open source from top to bottom, and is 'free software', meaning you can make changes and distribute them to others freely.

### Generic

By design, Parallax doesn't require specialized hardware to run. While higher end hardware will improve performance, Parallax can easily run on budget hardware.

### Easy

While being technically mindedly will certainly help, Parallax doesn't require professional installation or setup to function. As long as you're reasonably experienced with the Linux command line, setting up Parallax should be a piece of cake.

### Reliable

Parallax is designed to be as simple and purpose-built as possible to prevent bugs that would otherwise go unnoticed.

### Subdued

Unlike other navigation utilities, Parallax is designed to be quite and subdued, and to sit in the background dormant until you need it. This makes it the perfect tool to run while exploring, when you don't necessarily need direction, but want an assistant on hand in case you need it.

### Private

Since Parallax is open source, self hosted, and self contained, you can rest assured that it's completely private, and it doesn't collect any of the information you provide it.

### Customizable

Parallax is extremely customizable, making it easy to fit into your driving style and needs.

### Mobile

Parallax is designed to support low-energy-usage hardware such that it can be easily installed in a vehicle. A single USB port is enough to power an entire Parallax system.

### Safe

Parallax takes an entirely new approach to navigation. Instead of pulling your focus away from driving with graphics, noises, and animations, Parallax is designed to work seamlessly with your driving to keep your focus where it's needed most.

### Documented

Parallax's extreme customizability can be a bit overwhelming to new users. For this reason, the entire platform is extensively documented, and comes bundled with step-by-step guides on how to download it, install it, configure it, and run it.

### Unified

Parallax is intended to integrate seamlessly with the rest of your vehicle's software additions, and is designed to run side-by-side with Predator and Assassin.

### Unique

If you're looking for a traditional navigation program, Parallax almost certainly isn't for you. However, if you want a completely reimagined driving experience that puts the driving before the destination, Parallax is absolutely an option consider.
